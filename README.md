# UC_CEAS_Ross3jl

If you have happened to stumble upon here, then hello. THis is just my personal dumpster for projects to get aquainted to GIThub and keep some sort of record of the work I do with coding at school. You can poke around if you'd like. If you find something useful then have at it. It would be nice to drop me a line if you do. ross3jl@mail.uc.edu
